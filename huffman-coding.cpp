// Huffman suggested that we can reduce the size of a text composed of characters 
// consider ABDCDFDFLKJDLKFJSDLKFJDS 
// Now if we go with ASCII repreentaion we will need a code 8bit * No of letters
// so we are needing 8 bit even we are not using other letters so we should find other method 
// so construct a optimal tree and then decode and ecnode as per it should marginally reduce the size
