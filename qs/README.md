In the file whre shortes path between two nodes is asked we , when we use parent array using bfs ,not in cyclic loop it will not give the shortes path, it depends upon the inscertions
sine you will traverse the children and use on found break logic from queue, So BFS will surely give the shortest path in case of directed/ undirectedd non-weighted acyclic graph
